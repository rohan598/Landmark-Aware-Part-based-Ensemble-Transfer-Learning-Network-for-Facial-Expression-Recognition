# Landmark-Aware and Part-based Ensemble Transfer Learning Network for Facial Expression Recognition from Static images

## Introduction
In this work, we have developed a technique that captures the human ability to recognize the spatial orientation of facial features and use that for facial expression recognition. 

It is described in an [arXiv tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11274). 

In this repo, a generic summary notebook is provided for the project at the moment.
